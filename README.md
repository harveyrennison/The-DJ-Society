## 🎧 About

The DJ Society is a platform built for people our age who love music and want to start DJing but don’t know where to begin. This site aims to bridge that gap by offering:

- 📝 Advice for beginner and intermediate DJs  
- 🎶 Curated new music recommendations  
- 🛠 Tips on gear, technique, and setup  
- 📍 Info on local gigs and events  

Whether you're just curious or ready to jump on the decks, we’ve got something for you.

## 💡 Why?

As two beginner DJs freshly into the scene ourselves, we noticed there are *tons* of people who want to get into DJing but don’t know where to start. This site is designed to be a chill, friendly space to learn, share, and grow as a DJ.
